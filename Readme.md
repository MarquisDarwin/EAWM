# EAWM
To help understand our intuition and rationale for our framework, we showcase visualization of observations and events generated by our world models on both the Atari 100k benchmark, DeepMind Control Suite, and DMC-GB2 benchmark. We also provide experimental results with fixed hyperparameters over 5 random seeds across benchmarks.

We will release our code to promote future work to develop **Event-Aware World Model**.
